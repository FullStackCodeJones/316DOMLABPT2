Welcome to my DOM Manipulation project💣. This web app is a showcase of dynamic interactions using JavaScript to add life to a HTML page. A menu that actually listens to you! Click an option, and boom—you've got more options right below, as if the webpage is saying, “I got you😎.”

What This Project Does:

Explore Top Menu Items: When you click “About,” “Catalog,” or “Orders,” submenu options pop up.
Dive into the Submenu: Inside "Orders," you’ll see "New," "Pending," and "History." Click one, and the main section updates to let you know where you are!
Basically, it’s a page that listens, updates, and feels a bit interactive, so we’re not staring at a static webpage all day.

Tech Stack
HTML for layout and structure
CSS for a bit of visual spice—colors, fonts, and spacing
JavaScript to bring it all to life!

HTML sets up the base, including placeholders for the menu areas.
CSS adds color and style, pulling from a custom color scheme that’s easy on the eyes.
JavaScript manages the interactive parts—adding, hiding, and updating menu items with each click.
The Main JavaScript Functions
buildSubmenu(subLinks): Builds the submenu items based on which main menu item you clicked.
Event Listeners: These make sure that when you click on a top menu item or a submenu item, the right part of the page responds.
I tried to break down tasks in the JavaScript into small, readable functions, making it easier to follow (and modify) in the future.
I STRUGGLLEDDDDDD.

What I Learned(and Googled...SN: Youtube and Google come in CLUTCH💯)
(I don't think that I want to do Front End lol just kidding... Kind of)
The trickiest part was getting the page to respond correctly for each click. JavaScript DOM manipulation can feel like a puzzle, and the solution usually involves a mix of patience and some trial-and-error moments(Uhmmmm LOTSSS of Trial and Error🤕). But it was worth it! This project helped me build a little confidence in handling the basics of dynamic interactions.

Future Goals
I'd love to add some cool animations and a bit more visual flair to the menus as a future project upgrade.

Special Thanks
Thanks to everyone who helped me piece together the code and walked me through the errors, (they some real ones #RTT61 4 Life💃🏽). I honestly couldn’t have done it without all the support, tips, and resources.

This is my DOM Manipulation project, and I'm excited to share it with you. Enjoy checking it out!
